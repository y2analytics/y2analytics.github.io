# Introduction {-}

The goal of these coding standards are to improve readability and reproducibility of code with the aim of increasing productivity and efficiency.

These coding standards were developed using significant contributions from the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) authored by Hadley Wickham. The original tidyverse style guide content has been modified to reflect the preferred styles and standards of Y2 Analytics.
