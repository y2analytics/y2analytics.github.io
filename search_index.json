This is true even if your plot has only two layers. After the first step, each line should be indented by two spaces. If you are creating a ggplot off of a dplyr pipeline, there should only be one level of indentation. # Good iris %&gt;% filter(Species == &quot;setosa&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length)) + geom_point() # Bad iris %&gt;% filter(Species == &quot;setosa&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length)) + geom_point() # Bad iris %&gt;% filter(Species == &quot;setosa&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length)) + geom_point() 5.3 Long lines ggplot2 allows you to do data manipulation, such as filtering or slicing, within the data argument. Avoid this whenever possible, and instead do the data manipulation in a pipeline before starting plotting. # Good iris %&gt;% filter(Species == &quot;setosa&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length)) + geom_point() # Bad ggplot(filter(iris, Species == &quot;setosa&quot;), aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length)) + geom_point() 5.4 Structure Generally, geom layers should come immediately after the initial ggplot layer. If the theme needs to be adjusted, do so at the end of the plot, after all other layers. Try to order layers in a sensible way that is easy to understand, i.e. grouping all geom layers together, grouping all axis manipulation layers together. Include the aes argument as the first argument in geom layers that require it. "]]
